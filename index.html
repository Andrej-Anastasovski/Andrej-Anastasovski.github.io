                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m a freelance web developer and graphic designer. My work focuses on creating responsive, functional websites and designing visuals that meet client needs. I combine technical skills with a design background to build websites that work well and look professional.</p>

                <p>Before becoming a web developer, I spent over two years working as a graphic designer. I gained experience in creating logos, branding materials, and other designs for businesses. This gave me an understanding of how important design is for user experience, which I now use in my web development projects. My goal is to ensure that the websites I create are not only functional but also well-designed and easy to use.</p>

                <p>In addition to my front-end focus, I have skills in Python, C#, and SQL, allowing me to take on full-stack projects when needed. I’m also pursuing a master’s degree in computer science with a focus on cybersecurity, which helps me approach projects with a deeper understanding of secure and scalable systems.</p>
